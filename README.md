# STM32WL + X-NUCLEO-IKS01A1 Project

This project involves using the **STM32WL microcontroller** in conjunction with the **X-NUCLEO-IKS01A1 expansion board** for sensor integration and **LoRa** communication. This setup demonstrates data acquisition from environmental sensors and transmission over a LoRa network.

> **Note**: Most of the code used in this project is derived from publicly available sources, examples, and libraries from STMicroelectronics and the LoRa community. My main contributions focus on configuration, integration, and project-specific customizations.


## Project Overview

- **Microcontroller**: STM32WL Series
- **Sensor Board**: X-NUCLEO-IKS01A1 (environmental sensors such as temperature, humidity, etc.)
- **Communication**: LoRa (Long Range wireless communication protocol)

### Key Features

- **Sensor Data Acquisition**: Reads data from the X-NUCLEO-IKS01A1 sensor board, including temperature, humidity, and other available sensors.
- **LoRa Communication**: Transmits sensor data over a LoRa network using the integrated LoRa transceiver on the STM32WL.
- **Code Sources**: The core code, including sensor handling and LoRa stack implementation, is largely derived from STMicroelectronics libraries and open-source projects.

## Getting Started

### Hardware Requirements

1. **STM32WL Development
 Board**
2. **X-NUCLEO-IKS01A1 Sensor Board**
3. USB cable for programming and power
4. LoRa antenna (if applicable)

### Software Requirements

1. **STM32CubeIDE** or any preferred STM32 development environment

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

## Important Notes on Code Origin

The code base for this project is largely derived and adapted from various sources, primarily:
- Basic customizations for sensor reading intervals and data aggregation.

- **STMicroelectronics' examples** for LoRa communication on the STM32WL.
- Adding advanced data processing or sensor fusion logic.
- **ST's X-NUCLEO-IKS01A1 libraries** for sensor management and data handling.

While the project-specific code is customized for this setup, I acknowledge the significant contributions of these libraries and codebases.
